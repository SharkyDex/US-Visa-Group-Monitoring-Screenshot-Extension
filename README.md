# US-Visa-Group-Monitoring-Screenshot-Extension
This chrome extension helps you send screenshots of the scheduling page to a telegram channel of your choice through the telegram bot API without  mutating any DOM elements. It just listens for activity and also hides sensitive data. This is not a web scraping tool nor automation tool, It just helps you send screenshots which you immediately can't, so your monitoring group is aware of the outcomes of your search. 

**Usage:**
Replace the empty strings with your bot and channel id within the quotes on lines 12 and 13 in server.js and it's good to fire up.

**To load unpacked extension:**
1. Go to chrome://extensions
2. Toggle developer mode on
3. Load unpacked
4. Load your website and see it working

**Note:** It works only on webpages loaded after the extension is added or enabled. If you add the extension after loading the webpage, reload it.

**Terms** This is strictly for closed group of friends or people who consent to share this data among themself, so that they might help each other in finding f1 visa slots. This script as it is doesn't inject scripts or interact with the actual website other than listening, so dont modify it to use it for illegal actions!
