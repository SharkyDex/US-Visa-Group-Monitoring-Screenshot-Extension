# US-Visa-Group-Monitoring-Screenshot-Extension
This chrome extension helps you send screenshots of the scheduling page to a discord channel of your choice through the discord web hooks without a need for a server or mutating any DOM elements. It just listens for activity and also hides sensitive data.

**Usage:**
Replace the empty string with you webhook url and it's good to fire up.
