# US-Visa-Group-Monitoring-Screenshot-Extension
This chrome extension helps you send screenshots of the scheduling page to a discord channel of your choice through the discord web hooks without a need for a server or mutating any DOM elements. It just listens for activity and also hides sensitive data.

**Usage:**
Replace the empty string with your webhook url within the quotes on line 175 and it's good to fire up.

**To load unpacked extension:**
1. Go to chrome://extensions
2. Toggle developer mode on
3. Load unpacked
4. Load your website and see it working

**Note:** It works only on webpages loaded after the extension is added or enabled. If you add the extension after loading the webpage, reload it.
